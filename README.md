# Overview
This project is a lightweight and simple tool that converts markdown files into a minimalist webpages.

It's build with a minimalist mindset wich makes it highly flexible and easy to use:

- 1. copy the _source_ folder and _index.html_ in a folder
- 2. add all markdownfiles
- 3. make a homepage via creating a _startpage.md_. Use it to link all other markdownfiles
- 4. for further customization (titles, headerbar,...) edit the _index.html_ and _source/page.html_ file 

✨ voilà ✨ ...that's it!
To create a public Website upload your folder to Github and activate GithubPages with main/root.

- Names of Markdownfiles can't contain special characters like "_"

## Inspiration and Background
The Inpiration for this project were the many lightweight RegEx-based parser from the Github User [Casualwriter](https://github.com/casualwriter). The thought of a really simple, selfcontained and minimalistic *Markdown $\Rightarrow$ Website* tool was fascinating.
